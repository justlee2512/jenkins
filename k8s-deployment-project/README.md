# Kubernetes Deployment Project

This project contains the necessary configurations and scripts to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster. Below are the details of the project structure and instructions for deployment.

## Project Structure

```
k8s-deployment-project
├── manifests
│   ├── deployment.yaml   # Defines the Kubernetes deployment configuration
│   ├── service.yaml      # Defines the Kubernetes service configuration
│   └── ingress.yaml      # Defines the Kubernetes ingress configuration
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.sh         # Shell script to automate the deployment process
└── README.md             # Documentation for the project
```

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your cluster
- Docker image of the application pushed to a container registry accessible by the Kubernetes cluster

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd k8s-deployment-project
   ```

2. **Update the manifests**:
   - Modify `manifests/deployment.yaml` to specify the correct Docker image and desired number of replicas.
   - Adjust `manifests/service.yaml` to set the appropriate service type and port mappings.
   - Configure `manifests/ingress.yaml` for routing external traffic to your service.

3. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```
   chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Check the status of the deployment using:
     ```
     kubectl get deployments
     kubectl get services
     kubectl get ingress
     ```
